# NCLAB-Capstone-Project
Repository for my capstone project in Python via NCLab
I am in the process of creating a program which will allow the user to calculate the monthly payments
for a new home purchase and much more.
the program will cover the following scenarios:
1. New home purchase
2. What if an additional payment is made?
3. Refinancing an existing mortgage
4. Approximate proceeds from a sale 

The program will provide spreadsheets as well as graphs showing current and furture payment examples.
This program will not take in to account escrow, taxes, or mortgage insurance.

Added arrays for monthly interest and principal.  Next step to work on data frames and graphs.

removed option of different down payments and added option for user to choose down payment

DataFrame for totals is complete.  Next up is graphs
