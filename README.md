# NCLAB-Capstone-Project
The following program uses various modules to calculate the following information for the user

1. Initial payments for purchase of a house
2. Refinancing an existing mortgage
3. What if I make an additional payment to principal?
4. Sales proceeds when the house sells

The program will be utilizing Tkinter as the GUI.

The program starts with options for the user.

Currently, the only option working is the mortgage calculation.
The option to close the program has been added, when the user has completed the task.

When the user presses submit for the mortgage calculator, this is the screen that appears

Once the information is entered, a check is made to ensure 
the information entered is accurate.
If not, the user will receive an error message.

Once the information is submitted, the user is given the option to verify the information submitted.
The user can choose to keep the information and press submit or make changes in the fields.

Once again, checks are made to ensure the correct information is entered.  Once entered the results
will be displayed along with a graph showing principal and interest payments over each month.  
The user will have the option to save the ammortization file as a .csv on the local computer

Once closed, the program will revert to the first window, giving the user the option to 
complete a newq task or end the program.

The only error encountered has been with the legend for the line graph.  I have not found a solution.
