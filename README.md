# NCLAB-Capstone-Project
The following program uses various modules to calculate the following information for the user

1. Initial payments for purchase of a house
2. Refinancing an existing mortgage
3. What if I make an additional payment to principal
4. Sales proceeds when the house sells

The program will be utilizing Tkinter as the GUI.

Progress to date includes the first two windows of the program, which includes the 
initial start page which asks the user to input the choices of one of
the four items mentioned above.
A second window will pop up once the choice is made.  I am currently finalizing the second window with 
the calculations for the payments.

The program will also provide the user with the option to save an amortization file 
to their local computer.  Graphs will also be provided to show the history of loan
payments.

Added verification window to program.  In the process of giving the user the option to make changes
