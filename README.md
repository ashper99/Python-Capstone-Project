# NCLAB-Capstone-Project
Repository for my capstone project in Python via NCLab
I am in the process of creating a program which will allow the user to calculate the monthly payments
for a new home purchase and much more.
the program will cover the following scenarios:
1. New home purchase
2. What if an additional payment is made?
3. Refinancing an existing mortgage
4. Approximate proceeds from a sale
The program will provide spreadsheets as well as graphs showing current and furture payment examples.
This program will not take in to account escrow, taxes, or mortgage insurance.
